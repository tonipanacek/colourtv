        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>"BECAUSE MAKING STUFF SHOULD BE FUN."</p>
        <p>Colour TV are lovely; says everyone, EVER. We were going to do client testimonials but they make us feel a bit sick, so we thought we would do one for ourselves. Whether you want to do a lil arty music video, fun times sketch, sweet short film or a big fucking feature, we’re your people. We can make your thing look super expensive, even when we all know its not.</p>

        <p>Jay Pond-Jones founded Colour TV following the success of Flipside TV, which aired across Channel 4 and Paramount Comedy. Since then Colour TV has succeeded in making various comedy and scripted content including Fullscreen’s entertainment series Vetch 101, The Midnight Beast’s Valentine, a musicals comedy for Sky Arts, and Vimeo pilot, All Killer. In a mental turn of events we have recently just completed filming on our first feature which stars legends, Sylvia Syms and Peter Bowles and is due to be released in 2018. Very exciting stuff.</p>

​

        <p>In addition to our experience in traditional broadcast media we have "excitingly" also managed to become the first UK based company to delve into the scary world of online entertainment? .... The internet. Online. The great unknown. Big data. The WORLD WIDE WEB. YouTube. Youtubers? Confused? We got you. We first met YouTube sensations and MEGA babes Jack and Dean in 2015 who we continue to work with following the success of their Fullscreen series Jack and Dean Of All Trades which starred Jessica Hynes, and  was commissioned for a second series and featured the dreamy Jacob Anderson, google him.</p>



        <p>They then wandered round saying how GREAT we are and we have since stolen all their friends.  We now have the pleasure of producing work for the likes of; Will Darbyshire, Dodie Clark, Bertie Gilbert, Sammy Paul, Khyan Mansley, Hazel Hayes, Pj Liguori and many more wonderful members of the internet.</p>



        <p>We have had a great time over the last few years making lovely things with lovely people and want to keep doing it, FOREVER. If you want to join in on the fun please give us a call, drop us an email or take us out for lunch. We are always hungry.</p>
